# Field iterator derive

This crate is a supporting library for the `field_iterator` crate. It provides the proc macro `Iterable` to provide an easy way to make a struct iterable in Rust.

**Please note:** This crate is not intended to be used directly. If you want to make your structs iterable, please use the `field_iterator` crate instead.

Please visit the [`field_iterator` crate on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/field_iterator) for more information and usage examples.
